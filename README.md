👋 Hi, I’m Onditi, Kenneth.
👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of and active application of how to integrate code, machine learning, and AI into scientific research.
🌱 I’m currently a learner in these fields, scouring the internet for free courses, discussion forums, Q&As, and videos.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientific projects that integrate coding, machine learning and AI into researching the genomics of faunal adaptation to changing climates and human landscapes, especially for narrow-ranged specialist Afrotropic mammals or plants.
